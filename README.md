### NOTES

> AUTHOR OF THE LIB "_isLib" : Lukas Gaucas (projektorius96)

> MOTIVATION : thanks to idea learn (Go)lang, & of course, thanks to the authors of Go programming language given to use programmers to explore

> INTRO : Each struct-like object destructured key property is utilised just as a placeholder for native JavaScript type itself, subsequently called on function is() this. keyword as the result implemented by functions such as checker() found in the provided examples below :..

**_isLib_v1.js** is quite obselete as type (T) checking parameter must be manually typed in as follows : e.g. 'string', 'number', 'boolean'

**_isLib_v2.js** (same as index.js) is improved version whereas instead of manual type (T) typed in, we just name the struct-like object destructured key property
